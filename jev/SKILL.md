name: jev
description: Get a fast, cheap, typed judgment over text or JSON from the jev CLI: a yes/no probability, one choice among labels, or an ordinal score — bare calibrated answers, never prose or explanations. Runs now from a shell or agent, in bulk (one decision per line) and in pipelines (exit codes, semantic grep). Use to classify, triage, route, screen, rank, filter or bulk-label items such as emails, customer feedback, chat or group messages, tweets, logs, git diffs or user requests, and as a cheap pre-filter before expensive LLM reading, a guardrail check, or a model/agent router. 适用：分类、筛选、分诊、路由、打分、是非判断、批量打标签、语义过滤——只要结论，不要解释。Not for judgments that must come with an explanation, analysis or a written reply; not for writing, summarizing or extracting text; not for math or date arithmetic. To design or code a TypeSafe integration inside an application, use the official `typesafe-ai` skill. Unofficial; calls TypeSafe's Jev model through the TypeSafe API (default) or OpenRouter.

compatibility: Requires Python 3.9+, network access to api.typesafe.ai (default) or openrouter.ai, and a TYPESAFE_API_KEY or OPENROUTER_API_KEY.

# jev

`jev` turns a judgment call into a typed answer with a calibrated probability. It reads a state (text or
JSON) and answers named questions of three kinds — `noul` (P(yes)), `choice` (one of N), `score`
(ordinal scale, at most 10 levels). It never generates text. A call costs about $0.00002, so 1,000
decisions run about 2 cents: use it wherever a script or an agent needs a quick, consistent verdict,
and keep LLM reasoning for what survives the filter.

## Setup

1. Run `jev --version`. If the command is missing, the CLI ships with this skill at `scripts/jev`
   (Python 3.9+, standard library only). Link it with `mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && ln -sf "<this
   skill's directory>/scripts/jev" ~/.local/bin/jev`, or call it by its absolute path.
2. Keys: `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` (default provider) or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, read from the environment, then
   `$JEV_ENV_FILE`, then `<config dir>/.env`. Provider: `--provider` → `$JEV_PROVIDER` → the default
   pinned with `jev provider default ID` → auto (TypeSafe if its key exists, else OpenRouter).
   `jev provider list`, `jev auth status` and `jev auth check` are read-only and never print a key —
   run them freely. On a missing key or a 401/403, ask the user to run `jev auth set` (plus
   `--provider openrouter` for that key) in their own terminal: it needs a TTY and hidden input, so
   you cannot run it for them. Never ask for a key in chat, pass one as an argument, pipe one into
   `auth set --stdin`, read or print a key file, or run `jev auth remove` unless the user asks.

For designing the questions themselves (choosing `noul`/`choice`/`score`, writing `criteria`,
confidence and calibration semantics), see TypeSafe's own docs:
[primitives](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives.md), [confidence](https://docs.typesafe.ai/confidence.md),

## Choose the verb

| Need | Command | Plain stdout | Exit code |
|---|---|---|---|
| Yes/no | `jev yes "QUESTION"` | `yes\t0.97` | 0 yes · 1 no · 2 error |
| One of N | `jev pick "QUESTION" a="desc" b="desc" [--other]` | `a` | 0 · 1 below `--min-confidence` · 2 error |
| Ordinal score | `jev score "QUESTION" low mid high` or `--range 1-5` | `1.43\tmid` | 0 · 2 error |
| Keep matching lines | `jev filter "QUESTION"` | the matching input lines | 0 some · 1 none · 2 error |
| Several questions at once | `jev run SPEC` | aligned table | 0 · 2 error |
| Raw API body | `jev raw < body.json` | response JSON | 0 · 2 error |

- Input comes from stdin, `-s "TEXT"` or `-s @file`. JSON objects and arrays go out as structured state (`--text` turns that off).
- `-l` makes one decision per input line: concurrent (`-j 8`), order preserved, streamed. For JSONL, `--field KEY` names the field to judge. `filter` always works per line.
- Add `--json` whenever you parse results (JSONL with `-l`): each answer has `type` plus `noul` and `yes`, or `choice`, or `score` and `label`; `choice` and `score` also carry `probabilities` and `confidence`. Plain output suits humans and shell tests.
- `--verbose` prints provider, model, latency, tokens and cost to stderr (`≈$` when the cost is an estimate).
- Speed: a single call opens a new connection, about 0.5–1 s in total. `-l` keeps each worker's connection open, so later calls take about 0.3–0.4 s. For more than a handful of items use `-l` or `filter` instead of looping single calls; raise `-j` for large batches (≤16).
- `yes` and `filter` take `-t P` (threshold, default 0.5) and `--true` / `--false` to spell out what yes and no mean. `pick -p` and `score -p` print the whole distribution.

```bash
jev yes "用户在要求退款吗？" -s "Zipic 一打开就闪退，钱退我！"          # yes	0.97
jev pick "该交给谁处理" code="写代码或改项目" research="需要联网查资料" --other -s "$request" --json
jev score "这条评价给几星" --range 1-5 -s @review.txt                  # 3.30	3
tail -f app.log | jev filter "日志表示用户可见的故障" --false "调试信息、正常请求"
jev run feedback -l --field text --json < tickets.jsonl > labeled.jsonl
```

## Write questions Jev can answer

Jev reads conditions literally and does not infer intent. In testing, `filter "包含具体可行动的信息"` passed an ad ("加微信领取免费 AI 课程，限时三天") at about 0.9, because an ad is literally actionable. `filter "消息给出了具体的技术、产品或行业信息" --false "闲聊、问候、广告、引流、卖课"` excluded it.

- State observable conditions, not goals. Define both sides with `--true` / `--false`.
- Describe every option (`name="description"`); add `--other` when the list may not cover every input. Order score labels low to high, 2–10 of them.
- Put questions about the same input into one spec: one call answers all of them for that input (`-l` still makes one call per line).
- Trim the state to what the question needs, well below the context limit — irrelevant text dilutes the signal; do math and date arithmetic in code and put the result into the state.
- Gate actions on certainty: act on high `confidence` or probability, ask the user or escalate on low ones (`pick --min-confidence 0.7`, `yes -t 0.8`). Jev only decides — narrow the set with it, then read, write or summarize the survivors yourself.

## Specs

`jev run` lists the specs; `jev run NAME` or `jev run path/to/spec.json` runs one. Built-ins: `mail` (category, urgency, needs reply, promo), `feedback` (intent, sentiment, needs human, churn risk), `signal` (worth reading, topic, novelty for chat messages, tweets, RSS), `commit` (Conventional Commit type, secret leak, breaking change, risk for `git diff --cached`), `route` (handler, complexity, needs web, needs private data for a user request). Built-ins ship as JSON so every Python 3.9+ can load them. A spec's own `model` (if set) is normalized for whichever provider is active.

A spec mirrors the API body. Save new ones under `<config dir>/specs/` (`~/.config/jev/specs/` unless `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set), which survives reinstalling the skill. JSON works on every supported Python; TOML needs Python 3.11+ (`tomllib`) and errors clearly below that:

```json
{
  "description": "One line shown by `jev run`",
  "threshold": 0.5,
  "questions": {
    "category": { "type": "choice", "instructions": "Which kind of request is this?",
      "criteria": { "bug": "Crash or broken feature", "billing": "Payment or license problem", "other": "None of the above" } },
    "urgency": { "type": "score", "instructions": "How soon must someone act?",
      "criteria": ["can wait", "this week", "today", "now"] },
    "needs_reply": { "type": "noul", "instructions": "The sender expects a personal reply",
      "criteria": { "true": "Asks a question or waits for a decision", "false": "Notice or receipt only" } }
  }
}
```

`criteria` differs by type: `choice` and `noul` take a `{name: description}` map (`noul` needs both `true` and `false`), `score` takes an ordered array, low to high. A question may hold only `type`, `instructions` and `criteria`; anything else is rejected before a request is sent.

## Limits

- Decisions only: no text, no field extraction. `score` allows at most 10 levels.
- TypeSafe native: 64K token context per request, 32K for state + the longest question, about 1,200 requests/min. OpenRouter: `https://openrouter.ai/api/alpha/decisions` is an **alpha** endpoint and may move — override with `JEV_BASE_URL` if it does.
- The CLI retries 429/5xx with backoff on both providers; errors go to stderr as `jev: API 错误 (HTTP n): …`, exit code 2.
